# My Stack Overflow Archive

This repository is meant to save some of the content from [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/)
that I feel is great or was really influential in my own progression as a developer.  The content stored
on this repository is here to benefit the Internet by providing developers with great, quality reference
material.  Although these older questions might not fit the SO format their historical significance
and knowledge is too important to lose to only those SO users with high enough reputation to see them.

This repository and its contents are taken from [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) in
accordance with the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)
license governing the content of the site.  As such the data stored in this repository is open to anybody
who wants to use it.  I don't really care if you attribute *me* if you use this material but you should
definitely attribute the people at [Stack Exchange](http://www.stackexchange.com/) and of course the
users who posted the question or answer.
