        <h1>My Stack Overflow Archive</h1>
        <p><a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is one of my favorite, most-visited
        sites on the Internet.  I really love the concept and, more importantly, the execution of the
        concept.  The Stack Exchange sites were a big part of me <a href="">getting a job in the
        development industry</a> and I think <a href="">as a solo developer looking to become professional
        getting involved in a community</a> is pretty important.  Basically, Stack Overflow is great.</p>
        <p>Sometimes though, they <a href="">do things I don't agree with</a> and take down valuable,
        but unfit, content.  I understand the rationale, keeping the site pruned of wasteful material
        is a great thing that makes Stack Overflow better and more effective than its competitors.
        I also understand though that some of the content being removed is winding up being some of
        the very same content that was instrumental in me, ya know, *becoming a developer.*  This is
        my attempt to gather up that material or anything else I find on the chopping block that might
        be useful to keep around.</p>
